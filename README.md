## Linux Distribution Ranking Web Application

## Overview

The Linux Distribution Ranking Web Application is a full-stack web application that allows users to rank and compare different Linux distributions based on various attributes and features. The application provides information about each distribution, such as its description, popularity score, performance benchmarks, and more.

## Features

- User-friendly interface for ranking Linux distributions.
- Detailed information about each distribution's features.
- User ratings and reviews for distributions.
- Dynamic display of distribution data using React components.
- Integration with Django backend for data storage and retrieval.
- Admin interface to manage distribution data.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Django
- **Database**: SQLite (for development)
- **Styling**: CSS, potentially with Bootstrap or other frameworks

## Components

### Django Backend

- Models:
  - LinuxDistribution
    - Fields: name, description, logo, release_date, version, website, documentation, popularity_score, overall_rank, performance, community_support, package_manager, desktop_environment, architectures, license, pros_and_cons, security_features, installation_method, package_repositories
  - User Ratings/Reviews (if implemented)

### React Frontend

- Components:
  - DistroList: Displays a list of Linux distributions.
  - DistroDetail: Displays detailed information about a specific distribution.
  - DistroRating: Allows users to rate and review distributions.
  - AdminPanel: Provides an interface to manage distribution data.

### Data Flow

1. Users access the application via a web browser.
2. The React frontend fetches distribution data from the Django backend using API requests.
3. Users can view distribution information, rate distributions, and leave reviews.
4. Ratings and reviews are stored in the backend's database.
5. Admin users can manage distribution data through the Django admin interface.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Set up the Django backend:
   - Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Run migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
   - Create a superuser: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
   - Run the development server: `python manage.py runserver`
3. Set up the React frontend:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory: `cd frontend`
   - Install dependencies: `yarn install`
   - Run the development server: `yarn start`

## Future Enhancements

- User authentication and user-specific features.
- Enhanced user interface and data visualization.
- Integration with external APIs for real-time data.
